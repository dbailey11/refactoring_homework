# refactoring_homework

Refactored and debugged the main website for Horiseon. Changed the div elements to semantic elements to make the code easier to read and understand. Also condensed the css styling to make the file easier to understand and to work better with the html file. 

To make the webpage more accessible I added alt tags and fixed the nav links. All links will take you to their corresponding sections.
